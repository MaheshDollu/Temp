A Git project is a repository that contains a collection of files and directories, along with the entire history of changes made to those files. The project is managed using Git, a version control system, which provides the ability to track changes, create branches for independent development, merge changes, collaborate with others, and easily navigate through the project's history. Git projects enable efficient and organized software development by allowing teams to work on different features simultaneously, roll back to previous versions if needed, and maintain a comprehensive record of all modifications made to the codebase over time.
