Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by tracking changes to files over time, providing branching and merging capabilities, and enabling efficient code sharing through remote repositories. It allows developers to easily manage and navigate project history, selectively stage changes, and resolve conflicts, making it an essential tool for efficient and organized software development.
